             Here are some rules of the game:
             
             1. You will start with $1000 of cash. Upon encountering some scenarios you may lose or gain cash.
             2. After each scene is described, a corresponding letter will indicate its action.
             3. Typing anything other than the given letters will result in you losing.
             4. If your balance should ever reach $0, you automatically lose the game.
             5. Some scenarios and options in the game can get you killed, meaning your entire walk of danger would end :(
             6. If you survive all the scenarios and have cash left, you win!
